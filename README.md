# How it works
imagegen.py is used to create a large index of several hundred thousand images hosted on a remote server.
getterbot.py is then used to read this index every 30 minutes and posts one at random to Twitter.

ftpinfo.txt and twitinfo.txt must be filled out appropriately in order for these Python files to function.

# Why the fuck is it here
This code can be freely used to create imagebots of any nature, without credit.
imagegen_unbiased.py and getterbot_unbiased.py are slightly more basic programs that have the same functions, but every image in every folder has an equal chance of being picked, instead of each "show" having an equal chance of being picked.
